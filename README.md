| The need to maintain multiple online support channels (e.g., Facebook, Instagram, YouTube) alongside the chatbot | The chatbot will use Browser Automation *(Puppeteer)* to manage interactions on Facebook and can be extended to other websites and services. This enables centralized automation of multiple support channels from a local server, enhancing security and efficiency. |
| Manual and repetitive tasks in processing and managing documents, programs, scholarships, and student information | The chatbot, as a server, can handle repetitive or management tasks, assisting students, faculty, and teachers. This will free up time for improving services and providing more focused support. |
